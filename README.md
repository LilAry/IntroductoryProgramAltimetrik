# GAMEFINDER WEB
Hi there! On this repository I have been working on a proyect for a bootcamp I'm doing. GAMEFINDER is a web of games provided from https://rawg.io/ API. 
I made the pages from scratch form Figma design, with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. The first page has a Log in working with Json server for authentication. The second page is a searching game platform, with more than 3.500 games!
I want to give a very special apreciation to all of the members of Altimetrik BEFEDA bootcamp, withouth you this couldn't have been possible, thank you so much for all the dedication that got me an all group to grow up as future frontend developers.
