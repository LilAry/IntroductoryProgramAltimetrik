# IntroductoryProgramAltimetrik
Hello there! Welcome to my Github. My name is Ariadna Ferreira, I'm 23 years old, student of Informatic Engineering.
Recently, I have started a bootcamp of front end development with Altimetrick, I'm thrilled with this opportunity. I will be posting here all my documents, material and progress. I hope this helps someone in the future, so feel free to use any information you need from here! 
Good Luck :)

All the information and documentation i used for working here will be link below:
