# WEEK NUMBER ONE
## Javascript
Javascript is basically a high-level interpreted programming language used to make web pages more interactive. Have you ever thought that your website is missing something?
Maybe it's not engaging enough or it's not as creative as you want it to be. Now Javascript is that missing piece which can be used to enhance web pages, applications etc. to provide a more user-friendly experience. Javascript is the language of the web, it is used to make the web look alive by adding motion to it. To be more precise it is a programming language that lets you implement complex and beautiful things or design on web pages. So when you notice a web page doing more than just sitting there, you can bet that the web page is using Javascript. 
It is an object based scripting language, which supports polymorphism, encapsulation and to some extent inheritance as well.
JavaScript is a programming language and like other programming languages it has its own syntax. If we do not write a syntax that JavaScript understands, it will raise different types of errors.
## HOW TO USE JAVASCRIPT ON YOUR WEBSITE PROJECT?
There are 2 main methods: **INTERNAL JAVASCRIPT** and **EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT**
  When the script codes are presented in the same HTML file of it witch be used, we say that it is an **Internal Javascript** 
  
  ```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Javascript Syntax and Basic Constructs</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>

    <!-- Javascript area -->
    <script>
      console.log('Hey, Javascript!!');
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
