# GAMEFINDER WEB
Hi there! On this repository I have been working on a proyect for a bootcamp I'm doing. GAMEFINDER is a web of games provided from https://rawg.io/ API. 
I made the pages from scratch form Figma design, with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. The first page has a Log in working with Json server for authentication. The second page is a searching game platform, with more than 3.500 games!
