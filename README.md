Hello there!:wave: :wave: Welcome to my Github repository. My name is Ariadna Ferreira, I'm 23 years old, student of Informatic Engineering.
Recently, I have started a bootcamp of front end development with Altimetrick | 2nd edition, I'm thrilled with this opportunity. I will be posting here all my documents, material and progress. I hope this helps someone in the future, so feel free to use any information you need from here! 
Good Luck :)
